<h1><b>About Me</b></h1>
<p>Hey! I'm Ikpeama John. Coding has changed my world. It's not just about apps but the beauty of creating and designing. 
Learning to code has given me problem-solving skills and a way to communicate with others on a technical level. 
I can also develop websites and use my coding skills to get a better job. At first it seemed like it was impossible because everything about coding looked foreign and puzzling to me but once i came across the amazing course by Angela Yu things became easier and more comprehendable. 
I started with HTML for a beginners level and learnt how to use CSS ( Cascading stylesheet ) to design and improve my webpage. This amazing course helps improve creative minds, builds self-esteem and keeps one motivated.</p>
